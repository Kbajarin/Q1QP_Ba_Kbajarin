   <p class="h1">Variables</p>
   <p class="standard-text2" id="st">Taking a relatively large sample from Batch 2027, we have gathered information from 51 people from our community. A survey was conducted through Google Forms across the span of more than a week.</p>
   <p class="h2">Qualitative</p>
   <p class="standard-text2" id="st">The qualities that will be determined in this presentation will be the self-rating on image and perceived performance.</p>
   <p class="h2">Quantitative</p>
   <p class="standard-text2" id="st">The main quantitative variables in focus here are the values derived from the 3rd and 4th quarter grades of the 51 participants.</p>

    <p class="standard-text2" id="st2">Since the Median is very similar to the mean, we can say that the participants perform at similar levels. The IQR tells us that even though most of the participants perform similarly, some still perform worse than others and struggle. </p>

    <p class="h3" id="Conclufix">Conclusion</p>
    <p class="standard-text2" id="paraconclu">Three key topics emerge: self-confidence, academic performance, and grade data. These aspects shed light on students' self-assurance and scholastic achievements. According to the data, students generally hover around the midrange in terms of self-confidence, scoring an average of about 6 on a scale of 1 to 10. This suggests varying perceptions of their own abilities.</p>
    <p class="standard-text2" id="paraconclu">Regarding academic performance, students exhibit commendable dedication to their studies, reflecting the seriousness of education at this science high school. It's worth noting that despite stereotypes, this institution boasts a diverse range of talents. Furthermore, the data underscores a positive correlation between self-confidence and high grades.</p>
    <p class="standard-text2" id="paraconclu">The grade data from the third and fourth quarters offer insights into academic progress over time, showcasing variations in students' performance. However, the underlying causes of these fluctuations remain unclear in this dataset. Future research could explore factors like study habits, environment, or learning conditions that influence quarterly academic success. This dataset emphasizes the complexity of the relationship between self-confidence, self-perceived academic performance, and actual scholastic achievement, setting the stage for deeper investigations into the intricate dynamics that shape academic success.</p>
